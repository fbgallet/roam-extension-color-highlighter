# roam-extension-color-highlighter

Highlight text with different colors or write text with different colors. Keyboard only.

Select some part of your text, add Highight with native Roam hotkeys (Ctrl-Cmd + h), then press a letter corresponding to the first letter of the color, e.g. 'g' for Green. If you press Shift + a letter, the color will be more vivid. It will insert a tag like `#c:green` before highlight or bold markup, and the cursor will be positionned just after the colored text (or as selection of the colored text, in option).

Bonus: two commands to remove all colors tags of current block or all format markups (^^, \*\*, \_\_)

Currently keyboard only, I could add some visual UI in the future.

Credit to @CatoMinor3 for the great CSS trick allowing to customize highlighted and bold texts in Roam!
